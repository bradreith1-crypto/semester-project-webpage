<h2><p>Part 1: Equipment</p></h2>
<p>Your equipment is very important because faulty equipment can cause physical harm <ul>
    <li>if your clothing isnt warm enough, it can cause sickness such as hypothermia or a common cold</li>
    <li>if your skis are too long or too short, you wont be able to control your direction correctly</li>
    <li>if your boots are to big, they could slip off and take your skis with them</li>
    <li>a helmet is optional, but without a good helmet, you could get major head injuries from a single crash into any solid object</li>
</ul> </p>
    
<h2><p>Part 2: Know the Mountain</p></h2>
<p>You need to understand the rules of the mountain and what the signs mean <ul>
    <li>greens mean they are the easiest on the mountain and a kindergartener could complete them</li>
    <li>blues are a step above green and mean about a 5th grader could complete them</li>
    <li>blacks are the hardest on the mountain and an adult or highly skilled teen could complete it</li>
</ul></p>

<h2><p>Part 3: Getting up the slopes</p></h2>
<p>To get up to the top of the mountain you can use one of two methods. <ul>
    <li>the first way is the chair lift for getting high up on the mountain in comfort</li>
    <li>the second way is the t-bar lift, which you grab on so it can pull you up the slopes</li>
    <li>the third way isnt necessarily found all over the mountains, it is the magic carpet which is like a conveyor belt you stand on</li>
</ul></p>

<h2><p>Part 4: Getting down the slopes</p></h2>
<p>The most important thing to learn to get down the mountain safely is how to stop and stay in control.<ul>
 <li>if you are a noob, you can position your skis in a pizza shape to slow down</li> 
    <li>the proper way is to position your skis parallel of eachother and turn from side to side, moving down the slope in a snakey manner</li>
</ul></p>
